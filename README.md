## Translation

Language files are stored in the `plugins/HappyGifts/lang/` folder. The plugin comes with a default English language file (`en.yml`). To add a new language:

1. Copy the `en.yml` file
2. Rename it to your language code (e.g., `es.yml`, `de.yml`)
3. Translate all strings in the file
4. Change the `language` setting in `config.yml` to use your language

## Commands

- `/gift`: Opens the main gift menu
